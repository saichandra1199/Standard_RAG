üîÅ Notes on Customer Base Evolution

The chemical and agrochemical segments remain the core.


There‚Äôs a clear shift away from pharmaceutical clients after 2021‚Äì2022.


2023‚Äì2024 shows diversification into oil & gas and industrials (e.g., ADNOC, Halliburton, IndianOil, NRL, Bharat Petroleum).


New global industrial and specialty chemical clients are joining (Colorobbia, Arxada, Nouryon, MoL).


The receivables collection period for FY 2023-24 is calculated as:

Receivables Collection Period (days)=Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio365 
From the consolidated ratio analysis (Note 38), the Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio for FY 2023-24 is 7.94 times . Therefore:

Receivables Collection Period=7.94365 ‚âà45.97 days
So, on average, Aarti Industries collects its receivables in about 46 days during FY 2023-24.

The payables period measures how many days, on average, the company takes to pay its suppliers. It‚Äôs calculated as:

Payables Period (days)=Trade Payables Turnover Ratio365 
From the FY 2023-24 ratio analysis (Note 38), Aarti Industries‚Äô Trade Payables Turnover Ratio was 10.78 . Therefore:

Payables Period=10.78365 ‚âà33.9 days
So, on average, Aarti Industries takes about 34 days to settle its trade payables in FY 2023-24.

For the year ended March 31, 2024, Aarti Industries‚Äô inventory turnover ratio was 4.68 times, as per the consolidated ratio analysis in Note 38 of the Annual Report

The cash conversion cycle (CCC) measures the number of days between outlay of cash for inventory and recovery of cash from receivables.  It is computed as:

CCC=Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)Inventory Turnover365   +Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)Receivables Turnover365   ‚àíDays Payables Outstanding (DPO)Payables Turnover365   
For FY 2023-24, from the consolidated Ratio Analysis (Note 38):


Inventory Turnover Ratio = 4.68 


Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio = 7.94 


Trade Payables Turnover Ratio = 10.78 


Plugging in:


DIO = 365 √∑ 4.68 ‚âà 78.0 days


DSO = 365 √∑ 7.94 ‚âà 46.0 days


DPO = 365 √∑ 10.78 ‚âà 33.9 days


Therefore:

CCC‚âà78.0+46.0‚àí33.9=90.1 days
So, on average, Aarti Industries‚Äô cash is tied up in the operating cycle for about 90 days in FY 2023-24.

Aarti Industries first announced the brownfield expansion of its ethylation unit in its FY 2022-23 annual report (covering April 1, 2022‚ÄìMarch 31, 2023). In that disclosure, the company said it had ‚Äúembarked on expanding our Ethylation capacity at the Dahej SEZ, with a threefold increase, entailing an investment of ‚Çπ200 crores,‚Äù and targeted commissioning in the first half of FY 2025 
.

The expansion was commissioned in Q3 FY 2025 (the quarter ended December 31, 2024), when management reported that the ethylation facility had been ramped up from its original 8 KTPA to roughly 25‚Äì30 KTPA ‚Äúand got commissioned this quarter‚Äù 
. This was later reconfirmed in the Q4 FY 2025 results presentation (May 8, 2025), which noted ‚ÄúSuccessful commissioning of expansion projects in Ethylation value chain‚Ä¶ ethylation capacity expanding to 30 kT‚Äù 
.

Once in production, the enlarged ethylation capacity delivered a 38% year-on-year volume growth in FY 2025 (up to 14.5 KTPA from 10.5 KTPA in FY 2024), achieving about 48% utilization of the new 30 KTPA capacity
